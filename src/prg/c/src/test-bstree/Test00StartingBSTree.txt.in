Standard Populated Binary Serach Tree for Testing
=================================================


The standard populated binary search tree for testing purposes is populated with
the following words added in the order shown:-

consistency is all i ask give us this day our daily mask

The resulting bst tree can be pictorially represented as:-


				(0, 0)consistency[1]
					|
		-------------------------------------------------
		|						|
	 (-1, 1)all[1]					  (1, 1)is[1]
		|						|
		---------				-----------------
			|				|		|
		  (0, 2)ask[1]			  (0, 2)i[1]	  (2, 2)us[1]
							|		|
						---------	---------
						|		|
					 (-1, 3)give[1]	  (1, 3)this[1]
						|		|
					---------	---------
					|		|
				 (-2, 4)day[1]	  (0, 4)our[1]
					|		|
				---------	---------
				|		|
			 (-3, 5)daily[1] (-1, 5)mask[1]

Whilst the method of allocating coordinates does not result in a unique
coordinate, it is sufficient to prove tests.
