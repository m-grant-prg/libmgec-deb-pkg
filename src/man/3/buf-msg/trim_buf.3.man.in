NAME
trim_buf - Optimise an mgebuffer struct.
SYNOPSIS
#include <mgebuffer.h>

struct mgebuffer *trim_buf(struct mgebuffer *msg_buf);

DESCRIPTION
Remove processed data from a buffer object if deemed necessary. Re-sizing the
buffer every time this function is called would not be efficient. So, the
function first tests whether the buffer has a defined multiple
(BUF_UNUSED_DEF_SIZE_MULT) of the default buffer size (DEF_BUF_SIZE) free, and
if so shrinks the buffer and relocates valid data to the start of the buffer. If
that test does not result in action, the second test determines if the
percentage of unreachable portion of the buffer to the size of the buffer
exceeds a defined value (BUF_MAX_UNREACH_PERCENT), and if so, it relocates data
to the start of the buffer.
.br
On failure NULL is returned, the function argument is unchanged and
mge_errno will be set.

PARAMETERS
msg_buf - a pointer to the mgebuffer struct buffer to use.

RETURN VALUE
Return value is a pointer to the updated mgebuffer struct or NULL on error.

ERRORS
NULL is returned.

mge_errno is set as required. Possible values are:-
.RS
MGE_ERRNO due to realloc failure.
.RE

Functions arguments are unchanged.
