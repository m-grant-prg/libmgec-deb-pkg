NAME
mg_realloc - Wrapper for realloc to include error handling.
SYNOPSIS
#include <libmgec/mge-memory.h>

char *mg_realloc(char *mem_ptr, const size_t mem_sz);

DESCRIPTION
Performs a realloc() but makes a syslog entry on error.
.br
mge_errno will be set as required. If memory cannot be allocated then mge_errno
is set to MGE_ERRNO and sav_errno will be a copy of errno as set by malloc.
PARAMETERS
mem_ptr - a pointer to the memory area to be changed. As with realloc(), if
mem_ptr is NULL, mg_realloc acts as malloc().
.br
mem_sz - the new size required.

RETURN VALUE
Return value is a pointer to the new area of memory or NULL if an error occurs.
The pointer returned may be different from the one supplied, mem_ptr.
ERRORS
These values for mge_errno are defined in mge-errno.h:-

MGE_ERRNO - Memory allocation via malloc produced an error. See the copy of
errno in sav_errno and / or use mge_strerror(mge_errno).

If an error occurs, mem_ptr remains unaltered pointing to the still un-freed
original memory block.
