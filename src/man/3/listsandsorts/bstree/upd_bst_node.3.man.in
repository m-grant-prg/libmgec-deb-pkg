NAME
upd_bst_node - Update a node in a generic binary search tree.

SYNOPSIS
#include <mge-bstree.h>

void *upd_bst_node(const struct bstree *tree, const void *updobj,
		size_t objsize);

DESCRIPTION
See the Overview section of this manual page for a broad description of this
MGE General C Library implementation of a generic binary search tree.

upd_bst_node updates a binary search tree node with the data of 'updobj'. This
function only really makes sense if the object embedded in a node carries a
payload, i.e. object = key part + payload part.
.br
mge_errno will be set as required.

PARAMETERS
tree - a pointer to the binary search tree.

updobj - The object to find and replace. It does not need to be a fully
populated object. It only needs enough information to support the comparison
function. E.g. a key.

objsize - The size of the object.

RETURN VALUE
A pointer to the updated object, or, NULL if error, (See mge_errno).

ERRORS
These values for mge_errno are defined in mge-errno.h:-

MGE_PARAM - One or more supplied parameters are invalid.

MGE_ERRNO - Error allocating memory for the object. See the copy of errno
in sav_errno and / or use mge_strerror(mge_errno).

MGE_NODE_NOT_FOUND - The node containing the requested object does not exist.

EXAMPLE
An example using a struct as the object. (Note the comparison function):-

	#include <mge-bstree.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	int nodecmp(const struct testnode *node1,
			const struct testnode *node2);

	//...

	struct bstree *tree;
	struct nodeobj {
		char key[20];
		int payload;
	} obj;
	struct nodeobj *pobj;
	obj.key = "Bill";
	obj.payload = 1;

	tree = cre_bst(BST_NODES_UNIQUE,
			(int (*)(const void *, const void *))nodecmp);
	if (tree == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		return 1;
	}

	pt = add_bst_node(tree, &obj, sizeof obj);
	if (pt == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		tree = del_bst(tree);
		return 1;
	}

	tree = pt;

	// This will print Found object Bill with payload 1.
	pobj = find_bst_node(tree, &obj);
	if (!mge_errno)
		printf("Found object %s with payload %d\\n",
			pobj->key, pobj->payload;
	else
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));

	obj.payload = 999;
	// This will print Found object Bill with payload 999.
	pobj = upd_bst_node(root, &obj, sizeof obj);
	if (pobj != NULL)
		printf("Found object %s with payload %d\\n",
			pobj->key, pobj->payload;
	else
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));

	tree = del_bst(tree);

	// ...

	int nodecmp(const struct testnode *node1,
			const struct testnode *node2)
	{
		return (strcmp(node1->key, node2->key));
	}

OVERVIEW
This is one of a series of functions implementing a generic binary search tree.
It is generic because each node contains an object which can be of any type.

Binary search trees work by comparing nodes which means that we must have a
means of comparing 'objects'. In order to do this the consumer of the binary
search tree must provide a comparison function at tree creation time which has
the same prototype as strcmp, i.e.

int comparison_function(const void *parameter1, const void *parameter2)

returning a value of less than, equal to, or greater than zero depending on
whether parameter1 is less than, equal to, or greater than, parameter2.

Binary search trees are fundamentally mechanisms for storing and retrieving
objects related by contents and purpose. As such they can order lists and
provide speedy random access to their elements. In addition, a generic binary
search tree such as this, may be used to implement sparse arrays. A revealing
example of this would be a spreadsheet implementation where a binary search tree
would represent the spreadsheet as a sparse array and each node would represent
a cell. The 'object', (or cell), contained in each node could take the form:-

	struct cell {
		char *column;
		int row;
		char *contents;
		};

The column / row combination provides the cell reference, (e.g. A1), and the
contents is the payload of the cell, (a formula or value). The user-supplied
comparison function would obviously have to compare column and row.

This generic binary search tree implementation is supported by the following
functions:-

cre_bst() - create a new binary search tree.

add_bst_node() - add a node to the binary search tree or increment the counter
of a pre-existing node.

del_bst() - delete a binary tree, empty or not.

del_bst_node() - delete a node from the binary search tree or decrement the
counter of a pre-existing node.

find_bst_node() - find an object in the tree.

find_next_bst_node() - find the next object after the supplied object.

find_next_bst_node_trace() - find the next object and trace information after
the supplied object.

find_prev_bst_node() - find the object preceding the supplied object.

get_counter_bst_node() - find an object in the tree and return the node counter.

upd_bst_node() - Update the object in a node. This only makes sense if the
object has a key part and a payload part, so the match is made on the key and
essentially the payload is updated.
