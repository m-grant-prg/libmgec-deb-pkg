NAME
add_bst_node - Add a node to a generic binary search tree.
SYNOPSIS
	#include <mge-bstree.h>

	struct bstree *add_bst_node(struct bstree *tree,
			const void *object, size_t objsize)

DESCRIPTION
See the Overview section of this manual page for a broad description of this
MGE General C Library implementation of a generic binary search tree.

add_bst_node adds a binary search tree node with data of 'object' to a binary
search tree created with cre_bst(). If duplicates are allowed and a node exists
with 'object', then the node's counter is incremented.

.br
On error NULL will be returned and mge_errno will be set as required. In case of
error, the original bst will remain unchanged.
PARAMETERS
tree - a pointer to the tree to which the node should be added.

object - A void pointer to any type or struct.

objsize - The size of the object.

RETURN VALUE
A pointer to the tree, or, NULL on error. As the original bst remains unchanged
after error, it is important to preserve a pointer to the tree across this
function call.
ERRORS
These values for mge_errno are defined in mge-errno.h:-

MGE_PARAM - One or more supplied parameters are invalid.

MGE_ERRNO - Memory allocation for node or object via malloc produced an
error. See the copy of errno in sav_errno and / or use mge_strerror(mge_errno).

MGE_DUPLICATE_NODE - An object, matched via the tree comparison function,
already exists but the tree unique setting is set to BST_NODES_UNIQUE.
EXAMPLE
A simple example using a character string and the strcmp function for
comparison:-

	#include <mge-bstree.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	//...

	struct bstree *tree;
	struct bstree *pt;
	char *key = "John";

	tree = cre_bst(BST_NODES_UNIQUE,
			(int (*)(const void *, const void *))strcmp);
	if (tree == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		return 1;
	}

	pt = add_bst_node(tree, key, strlen(key) + 1);

	if (pt == NULL)
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
	else
		tree = pt;

	tree = del_bst(tree);


A more complex example using a struct as the object with comparison function,
nodecmp, supplied:-

	#include <mge-bstree.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	//...

	struct bstree *tree;
	struct bstree *pt;

	struct testnode {
		char key[20];
		int payload;
		};

	struct testnode test;
	strcpy(test.key, "John");
	test.payload = 100;

	tree = cre_bst(BST_NODES_DUPLICATES,
			(int (*)(const void *, const void *))nodecmp);
	if (tree == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		return 1;
	}

	pt = add_bst_node(tree, &test, sizeof test);

	if (pt == NULL)
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
	else
		tree = pt;

	tree = del_bst(tree);

	//...

	int nodecmp(const struct testnode *node1,
		const struct testnode *node2)
	{
		return (strcmp(node1->key, node2->key));
	}

OVERVIEW
This is one of a series of functions implementing a generic binary search tree.
It is generic because each node contains an object which can be of any type.

Binary search trees work by comparing nodes which means that we must have a
means of comparing 'objects'. In order to do this the consumer of the binary
search tree must provide a comparison function at tree creation time which has
the same prototype as strcmp, i.e.

int comparison_function(const void *parameter1, const void *parameter2)

returning a value of less than, equal to, or greater than zero depending on
whether parameter1 is less than, equal to, or greater than, parameter2.

Binary search trees are fundamentally mechanisms for storing and retrieving
objects related by contents and purpose. As such they can order lists and
provide speedy random access to their elements. In addition, a generic binary
search tree such as this, may be used to implement sparse arrays. A revealing
example of this would be a spreadsheet implementation where a binary search tree
would represent the spreadsheet as a sparse array and each node would represent
a cell. The 'object', (or cell), contained in each node could take the form:-

	struct cell {
		char *column;
		int row;
		char *contents;
		};

The column / row combination provides the cell reference, (e.g. A1), and the
contents is the payload of the cell, (a formula or value). The user-supplied
comparison function would obviously have to compare column and row.

This generic binary search tree implementation is supported by the following
functions:-

cre_bst() - create a new binary search tree.

add_bst_node() - add a node to the binary search tree or increment the counter
of a pre-existing node.

del_bst() - delete a binary tree, empty or not.

del_bst_node() - delete a node from the binary search tree or decrement the
counter of a pre-existing node.

find_bst_node() - find an object in the tree.

find_next_bst_node() - find the next object after the supplied object.

find_next_bst_node_trace() - find the next object and trace information after
the supplied object.

find_prev_bst_node() - find the object preceding the supplied object.

get_counter_bst_node() - find an object in the tree and return the node counter.

upd_bst_node() - Update the object in a node. This only makes sense if the
object has a key part and a payload part, so the match is made on the key and
essentially the payload is updated.
