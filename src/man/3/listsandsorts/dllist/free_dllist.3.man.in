NAME
free_dllist - Deletes a double linked list.
SYNOPSIS
	#include <dllist.h>

	struct dllistnode *free_dllist(struct dllistnode *root);

DESCRIPTION
See the Overview section of this manual page for a broad description of this
MGE General C Library implementation of a double linked list.

free_dllist deletes a double linked list.
.br
mge_errno will be set to 0 on return from this function.
PARAMETERS
root - Is a pointer to the root node.
Care must be taken to pass the pointer to the ROOT node as free_dllist deletes
from the node passed to the end of the list. If an intermediate node address is
passed, then the preceding node will have an invalid pointer.

RETURN VALUE
Return value is always NULL.
ERRORS
mge_errno is always set to 0 on return from this function.
EXAMPLE
A simple example using a character string:-

	#include <dllist.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	//...

	struct dllistnode *root;
	char *key = "John";
	root = NULL;

	root = add_dll_node(root, key, strlen(key) + 1);

	if (mge_errno)
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));

	root = free_dllist(root);

	// This will print Root node pointer: NULL, i.e. List deleted.
	printf("Root node pointer: %p\\n", root);

OVERVIEW
This is one of a series of functions implementing a double linked list. A double
linked list has forward and backward links to the next and previous nodes. The
node, which is defined in dllist.h, is shown below:-

	struct dllistnode {
		void *object;
		struct dllistnode *prevnode;
		struct dllistnode *nextnode;
	};

Each node in the linked list has an object as payload. It can be any form of
data element, memory permitting.

This double linked list implementation is supported by the following functions:-

add_dll_node() - add a node to the end of a double linked list.

find_prev_dll_node() - find the node prior to the supplied node.

find_next_dll_node() - find the next node after the supplied node.

free_dllist() - Delete the entire double linked list.
