NAME
free_sllist - Deletes a single linked list.
SYNOPSIS
	#include <sllist.h>

	struct sllistnode *free_sllist(struct sllistnode *head);

DESCRIPTION
See the Overview section of this manual page for a broad description of this
MGE General C Library implementation of a single linked list.

free_sllist deletes a single linked list.
.br
mge_errno will be set to 0 on return from this function.
PARAMETERS
head - Is a pointer to the root node.
Care must be taken to pass the pointer to the ROOT node as free_sllist deletes
from the node passed to the end of the list. If an intermediate node address is
passed, then the preceding node will have an invalid pointer.

RETURN VALUE
Return value is always NULL.
ERRORS
mge_errno is always set to 0 on return from this function.
EXAMPLE
A simple example using a character string:-

	#include <sllist.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	//...

	struct sllistnode *root;
	char *key = "John";
	root = NULL;

	root = add_tail_sll_node(root, key, strlen(key) + 1);

	if (mge_errno)
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));

	root = free_sllist(root);

	// This will print Root node pointer: NULL, i.e. List deleted.
	printf("Root node pointer: %p\\n", root);

OVERVIEW
This is one of a series of functions implementing a single linked list. A single
linked list has only a forward link to the next node. The node, which is defined
in sllist.h, is shown below:-

	struct sllistnode {
		void *object;
		struct sllistnode *next;
	};

Each node in the linked list has an object as payload. It can be any form of
data element, memory permitting.

This single linked list implementation is supported by the following functions:-

add_head_sll_node() - add a node to the beginning of a single linked list.

add_tail_sll_node() - add a node to the end of a single linked list.

find_next_sll_node() - find the next node after the supplied node.

find_sll_node() - find a node in the list

for_each_sll_node() - macro iterating over the list.

free_sllist() - Delete the entire single linked list.
