NAME
find_bst_node - Find a node in a generic binary search tree.
SYNOPSIS
	#include <bstree.h>

	void *find_bst_node(const struct bstree *tree,
		const void *searchobj);

DESCRIPTION
See the Overview section of this manual page for a broad description of this
MGE General C Library implementation of a generic binary search tree.

find_bst_node looks for a binary search tree node with data matching
'searchobj'.
.br
mge_errno will be set as required. (Searching for a non-existent node is not an
error). A return of NULL and mge_errno != 0 defines an error.

PARAMETERS
tree - a pointer to the binary search tree.

searchobj - The object to find. It does not need to be a fully populated
object. It only needs enough information to support the comparison function.
E.g. a key.

RETURN VALUE
A pointer to the found object, (i.e. the fully populated object), or, NULL if
not found or an error was encountered.

ERRORS
mge_errno is guaranteed = 0 if no error has occurred.
These values for mge_errno are defined in mge-errno.h:-

MGE_PARAM - One or more supplied parameters are invalid.

EXAMPLE
A simple example using a character string and the strcmp function for
comparison:-

	#include <bstree.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	//...

	struct bstree *tree;
	struct bstree *pt;
	char result[20];
	char *presult = result;
	char *key = "John";

	tree = cre_bst(BST_NODES_UNIQUE,
			(int (*)(const void *, const void *))strcmp);
	if (tree == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		return 1;
	}

	pt = add_bst_node(tree, key, strlen(key) + 1);

	if (pt == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		tree = del_bst(tree);
		return 1;
	}

	tree = pt;

	presult = find_bst_node(tree, key);

	// This will print Searching for object John, found object John.
	if ((presult == NULL) && mge_errno)
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
	else
		printf("Searching for object %s, found object %s\\n", key,
			presult);

	tree = del_bst(tree);


A more complex example using a struct as the object. (Note the comparison
function):-

	#include <bstree.h>
	#include <mge-errno.h>

	int nodecmp(const struct testnode *node1,
			const struct testnode *node2);

	//...

	struct bstree *tree;
	struct bstree *pt;
	struct nodeobj {
		char key[20];
		int payload;
	} obj;
	struct nodeobj *pobj;
	obj.key = "Bill";
	obj.payload = 999;
	root = NULL;

	pt = add_bst_node(tree, key, strlen(key) + 1);

	if (pt == NULL) {
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));
		tree = del_bst(tree);
		return 1;
	}

	tree = pt;

	// This will print Found object Bill with payload 999.
	pobj = find_bst_node(tree, &obj);
	if (!mge_errno)
		printf("Found object %s with payload %d\\n",
			pobj->key, pobj->payload;
	else
		printf("%s\\n", mge_strerror(mge_errno));

	tree = del_bst(tree);

	// ...

	int nodecmp(const struct testnode *node1,
			const struct testnode *node2)
	{
		return (strcmp(node1->key, node2->key));
	}


OVERVIEW
This is one of a series of functions implementing a generic binary search tree.
It is generic because each node contains an object which can be of any type.

Binary search trees work by comparing nodes which means that we must have a
means of comparing 'objects'. In order to do this the consumer of the binary
search tree must provide a comparison function at tree creation time which has
the same prototype as strcmp, i.e.

int comparison_function(const void *parameter1, const void *parameter2)

returning a value of less than, equal to, or greater than zero depending on
whether parameter1 is less than, equal to, or greater than, parameter2.

Binary search trees are fundamentally mechanisms for storing and retrieving
objects related by contents and purpose. As such they can order lists and
provide speedy random access to their elements. In addition, a generic binary
search tree such as this, may be used to implement sparse arrays. A revealing
example of this would be a spreadsheet implementation where a binary search tree
would represent the spreadsheet as a sparse array and each node would represent
a cell. The 'object', (or cell), contained in each node could take the form:-

	struct cell {
		char *column;
		int row;
		char *contents;
		};

The column / row combination provides the cell reference, (e.g. A1), and the
contents is the payload of the cell, (a formula or value). The user-supplied
comparison function would obviously have to compare column and row.

This generic binary search tree implementation is supported by the following
functions:-

cre_bst() - create a new binary search tree.

add_bst_node() - add a node to the binary search tree or increment the counter
of a pre-existing node.

del_bst() - delete a binary tree, empty or not.

del_bst_node() - delete a node from the binary search tree or decrement the
counter of a pre-existing node.

find_bst_node() - find an object in the tree.

find_next_bst_node() - find the next object after the supplied object.

find_next_bst_node_trace() - find the next object and trace information after
the supplied object.

find_prev_bst_node() - find the object preceding the supplied object.

get_counter_bst_node() - find an object in the tree and return the node counter.

upd_bst_node() - Update the object in a node. This only makes sense if the
object has a key part and a payload part, so the match is made on the key and
essentially the payload is updated.
